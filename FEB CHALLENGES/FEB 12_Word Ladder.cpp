// Word Ladder

/* Problem :
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.
*/

/* Approach :
1. First, we determine whether our endword is included in the word list or not.
Otherwise, we return 0.
2. The first thing we need to do is figure out how to create a graph for the provided question.
Our begin word will be the first node in the graph, and our end word will be the last node.
3.We change a maximum of one character from each node's string for its neighbor and determine whether or not it appears in our wordList.
The modified word then becomes the specified node's neighbor.
